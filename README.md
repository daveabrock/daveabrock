### Hello, fellow nerds!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dave Brock. I'm a software engineer who focuses on Microsoft and JavaScript technologies. Hopefully soon, I can update this to be more ... fun?

I most enjoy working the C#, .NET Core, and TypeScript.

At my site, [daveabrock.com](https://daveabrock.com), I write a lot about .NET and all the things I am trying to learn.

I also run a weekly newsletter called [The .NET Stacks](https://dotnetstacks.com/register). I keep you up to date on everything in the .NET community, but also provide thoughts on various topics and trends. It isn't just a link blast! I work hard on it and if you are into .NET give it a shot!
