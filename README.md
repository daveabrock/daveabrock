# Hey, friends!ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Dave Brock](https://daveabrock.com/). I'm a software engineer, writer, and speaker. 

By day, I help development teams work with Azure. By night, I enjoy writing, speaking, and hacking on various projects in the .NET, C#, and Azure areas.

At my site, [daveabrock.com](https://daveabrock.com), I write a lot about .NET and all the things I am trying to learn.

My favorite posts include:
