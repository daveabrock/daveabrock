### Hello, fellow nerds!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dave Brock. I'm a software engineer, writer, and public speaker who focuses on Microsoft and JavaScript technologies. Hopefully soon, I can update this to be more ... fun?

I most enjoy working the C#, .NET Core, and TypeScript.

At my site, [daveabrock.com](https://daveabrock.com), I write a lot about .NET and all the things I am trying to learn.

Some of my favorites include:
- [C# 8, A Year Late](https://daveabrock.com/2020/03/29/csharp-8-year-late)
- [Full-Stack Development in Visual Studio Code with ASP.NET Core](https://daveabrock.com/2018/03/06/full-stack-development-in-vs-code-with-asp-net-core)
- [First Look: C# Source Generators](https://daveabrock.com/2020/05/08/first-look-c-sharp-generators)
- [Party in the cloud with feature flags and Azure App Configuration](https://daveabrock.com/2020/06/17/use-feature-flags-azure-app-config)
- [C# 9 Deep Dive: Records](https://daveabrock.com/2020/07/06/c-sharp-9-deep-dive-records)

I also run a weekly newsletter called [The .NET Stacks](https://dotnetstacks.com). I keep you up to date on everything in the .NET community, but also provide thoughts on various topics and trends. It isn't just a link blast! I work hard on it and if you are into .NET give it a shot!
